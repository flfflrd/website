HTML/CSS for the moment\
I used to have a pretty good implementation of PHP and mySQL, but it got lost to the winds of time\
Just a handmade portfolio of my ability to make a LAMP stack server backend as easily as making a lasagna, and a project space for frontend design.\
I suck at frontend, HTML/CSS is so outdated, but I have baseless reservations about using frameworks like laravel. But I met some cool fellas from meetup.com that seem to like it so I'll give it a go soon
