Ok, PHP now, just so I can change the header without screwing around too much.\
Gonna put in SQL soon, for blogpost-style entries, and a login system again.\
Also, bloody IOS makes the pre-code divs font-size wack out no matter what I do\
so ignore that for now

- [ ] mySQL
- [ ] blogpost page
- [ ] login system
