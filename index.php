				<a href="https://linktr.ee/tristanfulford">linktr.ee/tristanfulford</a>
				<p>
				goddamn html/css dev is just insane<br>
				how did anyone do this back in the day? I just want a header, navbar and mainspace jeez
				<p>
				damn i love git. i have this site, several programming projects and my dotfiles all version controlled and easily accessible.<br>
				so I can make changes on my phone, my comp, on on the server directly and just git merge at worst<br>
				<p>
				this page now has a self-signed SSL certificate, so you can send me ur passwords and no-one else can see em :)<br>
				but it does show a big red screen saying "THIS ISNT A SAFE WEBSITE" just cos its not signed by a CA, so i might drop the $10 on<br>
				a shiny new cert
				<p>
				doing a bit of bloggy stuff so i might setup sql again
				<p>
				how do i make the footer stick to the bottom
				<p>
				<div style="width:100px;overflow-x:scroll;">
					<div style="width:1000px;">helloooooo</div>
				</div>
				<p>
				bloody pre-code sections have a different text size on my phone but theres
				no css to specify that, fk appl fr
			</div>
			<div class="footer">
				gruvbox theme coming soon<br>
