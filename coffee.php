					I'm a fiend for the caffeine
				</h1>
				I get a coffee every day.<br>
				It's a very expensive habit. $5 a day, $35 a week, $140 a month.<br>
				Thats like, four phone bills.<br>
				But it's worth it to have something to get up for in the morning, to talk to the nice people.
				<p>
				I go to Ben Baker's on North East Road 6 days a week, cos they're closed on sundays.<br>
				I know Alyssa's name, and none of the others, but I know their faces and they know mine.<br>
				"Just your medium latte?"<br>
				"Yes, please"<br>
				I fuckin love it.
				<p>
				I used to be a barista, and I got some wacky orders. One lady asked for like, half espresso, half decaf, with two types of milk<br>
				Just as the place was getting busy too. Like just get a normal coffee, man, whats the point?<br>
				Too easy to fuck it up, and you're just making it unnecessarily hard. Obscuring the quality of the coffee with your caramel pump<br>
				Heinous imo.
				<p>
				But Ben Baker's consistently makes one of the best coffees I've had. Never burnt, never low, always good crema. Lovely service. 10/10
				<p>
				So on Sundays, I'll go check out a new place. Feels like I'm cheating on my #1. Not that anywhere else even comes close<br>
				The Fresh Egg Shop, or Dutch Pantry on O.G. Road, the cafe there is so cool. Very good prices on eggs, $12.50 for 36 high-quality eggs, orange yolk style<br>
				Kinda place I'd take my mates after for a seedy sunday morning eggs benny after a night out, or a third-date<br>
				<p>
				I just went to The Lab on Payneham Road this morning. Cool place, private parking, didn't get the spark tho. Might try again next week<br>
